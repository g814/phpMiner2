# phpMiner2

phpMiner2 uses CPU and it is slower than normal CPU miner. You can mine on 
 a server without much trouble and run this on, for example, a webhost.

Run `test.php` for **testcase**.

Look in `work.php` for **example** how to use.

The proxy.php should have URI "/"

I am open for improvements and feedback.

## Usage

Via CLI:

Edit settings in `work.php` and run

	php work.php

or Via Browser:

Visit `work.php`-page
